# Simple Paintbrush

This is a simple project that allows to practice and review programming and logic concepts using mouse events in JavaScript. It is essentially a simplified version of a paintbrush application, and can be used to explore concepts such as event listeners, canvas rendering, and user input.

## Installation

To use this project, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/thiagolehmam/paintbrush.git

## Usage

Open the `paint.html` file in your web browser to launch the simple paintbrush application. The application allows you to click and drag the mouse to draw lines and shapes on the canvas.

## Concepts Covered

This project covers the following concepts related to mouse events and canvas rendering in JavaScript:

- Adding event listeners to respond to user input
- Accessing the canvas element and its context
- Handling mouse click, drag, and release events
- Calculating mouse coordinates and offsets
- Drawing lines, shapes, and colors on the canvas

By experimenting with and modifying the code in this project, it is possible to explore these concepts and gain a better understanding of how they can be used in projects.
